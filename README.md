## Introduction
Boating can be a lot of fun, but it also requires skill and experience to navigate safely. One of the biggest challenges for baoters is staying on course, especially when wind and waves are strong. This projects aims to solve that problem by developing a system that uses sensors to automatically correct the boat's position and keep it on course.

## Features
* Automatic boat position correction using sensors.
* Support for multiple sensor.
* Customizable settings for different weather conditions and types of boats.
* Integration with other navigation and communication systems.
